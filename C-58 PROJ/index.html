				The game of basketball was first played almost 128 years ago. The date of the first-ever basketball match was 21st December 1891. The beginning of a basketball era came in Massachusetts, the United States by the hands of an American gym teacher. The game then took its route and spread across Canada and gradually in many other parts of the world. In present times, basketball is a sport that is played internationally.
